    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    On the second day of our committee sessions, we delved into a variety of formatting techniques that are essential for effective communication and documentation. The day was structured to provide us with hands-on practice and a thorough understanding of these key elements.

One of the first topics we covered was the use of bold and italic text. Bold text is useful for emphasizing key points or highlighting important sections, while italic text is often used to stress specific terms or convey a particular tone. We practiced applying these formats in our documents to ensure clarity and emphasis.

Next, we explored superscripts and subscripts. Superscripts, such as "x²," are used for mathematical expressions, footnotes, or references, while subscripts, like "H₂O," are commonly used in chemical formulas. Understanding how to use these formats correctly is vital for technical accuracy and professional presentation.

We also learned how to insert and manage images within our documents. Images play a crucial role in enhancing visual appeal and supporting textual information. The session included guidance on resizing, positioning, and adding descriptive captions to maintain a professional appearance and accessibility.

Another important skill we developed was using the underline feature to draw attention to critical information. While underlining is less common in modern digital documents compared to bold or italics, it remains a valuable tool for highlighting specific content, especially in print materials.

In addition, we were introduced to horizontal rules. Horizontal rules are used to create visual separations between sections of a document. They help improve the organization and readability of long texts by clearly delineating different topics or sections.

Overall, Day 2 of our committee work was both informative and practical. Mastering these formatting techniques will enhance the quality and professionalism of our future reports, presentations, and communications. The hands-on exercises ensured that we could confidently apply these skills in real-time, strengthening our ability to produce clear and visually engaging documents.
