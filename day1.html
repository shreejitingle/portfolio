    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <p>I recently joined a committee where we had an introductory session with our mentor. During this session, we were introduced to our respective groups and got to know our fellow team members. Our mentor provided an overview of the committee's goals and our roles within it. On the first day, we began learning the basics of HTML. We covered fundamental concepts such as creating headings using  &lt;h1 &gt; to  &lt;h6&gt;tags and adding hyperlinks with the  &lt;a &gt; tag. This hands-on experience helped us understand how to structure web pages and link to other resources, laying the foundation for further learning.  &lt;p &gt;
